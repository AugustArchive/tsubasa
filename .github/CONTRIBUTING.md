## Ways on contributing
### Bug Reports
If you find a bug report, please report it in the **issues** section in this repository labeled `bug`.

Before you go on a rampage on bug reporting, please follow our guidelines before doing so:

- Be clear and concise with the title, it will help others link their issues and solutions to yours.
- Specify the ways to reproduce the bug, so our development team and contributors can reproduce by themselves.
- Show the output, using logs and screenshots, to help others understand your issue.
- If you're running a self-hosted version of **Tsubasa**, specify the specs you're running, distribution (locally, Docker), and the version and git commit hash before you report the bug.
